# LLF_scheduling_algorithm
simulation of least Laxity first scheduling algorithm using C.
input is provided in the form of a file which is named as input.txt.
first line of the input gives the no of processes.
Rest of the lines contain three paramters process_id , period of the process and its burst time.
If two processes have same laxity then the one that is currently executing is allowed to continue
